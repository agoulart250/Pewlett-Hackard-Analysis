# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Pewlett-Hackard (PH) is preparing for the "silver tsunami" as many of its employees are approaching retirement age. As part of this preparation PH wants to understand A) the number of retiring employees by tile and B) find out what employees are eligible for the mentorship program

![](./Data/retiring_titles.png).
- PH is has recently been awarded as one of the top employers to work for in the nation. And the numbers speak for themselves. Out of approximately 94 thousand employees in retirement age over PH's history, 64% of them has reached "Senior" level titles. This is certainly something to take pride of. It is a place where hard work and integrity are recognized.

- Another point to be made is that no function in specific is favored over another. When it came down to comparing functions at retirement age, both Engineers and Staff stack up high at senior level.

- Making the best use of its resources is top of mind in HP's leadership style. It's CEO is already thinking of the new generation of employees that will join its workforce and alog with that, how it can best use the knowledge and talent of its "mentorship" age employees to train its new talent and ultimately retain as much knowledge as possible as its veterans move on in their lives as future happy retirees. With that in mind, HP studied its mentorship contenders and it is good news. It has a more than 1 thousands seasoned employees ready to train the newbies.

- Approximately 700 of its existing mentorship employees are either Engineers or Senior Engineers. PH's technical training pool is all set to boost up its engineering power.


## Summary
To sum it up, there are approximately 70 thousand active employees with retirement on the pipeline.
PH has approximately 2 thousand active employees qualifying to its mentorship program.
That shows a ratio of 45 retirees for each mentor that stays to train new hires.
While this ratio may be intimidating, if PH times it well and paces retirement vs. new hires over the course of two years, then we are looking at a mentor to new hire ration of 1 to 4 per quarter, which is a much more digestable number. I believe this will come handy to PH's leadership.
